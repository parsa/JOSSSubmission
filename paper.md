# Summary

HPX is a C++ Library for Concurrency and Parallelism [@heller2017hpx; @hpx_github; @tabbal2011preliminary]
for distributed and parallel programming based on an Asynchronous Many-Task (AMT) runtime system.
Its main goal is to improve efficiency and scalability by increasing resource utilization and reducing synchronization through providing asynchrony and employing adaptive scheduling. HPX can significantly reduce processor starvation and effective latencies while controlling overheads.
In addition to providing scalable parallelism, HPX implements the concurrency mechanisms and parallelism facilities defined by the ISO C++ Standard yet extends them to run in a distributed context. Furthermore, HPX implements functionalities proposed as part of the ongoing C++ standardization process. [TODO: Maybe adding advantages of having HPX in c++ standardization compared to the other methods that are not?]

[TODO: Maybe talking about HPX future and dataflow and execution policies after going into HPX components!?]

The components of HPX and their references are listed below:

- **Thread Manager** [@kaiser2009parallex] The thread manager manages the
light-weighted user-level threads created by HPX. These light-weight threads
have extremely short context switching times resulting in the reduced latencies
even for very short operations. HPX provides the following pre-defined
scheduling policies **(?)**: static, thread-local, and hierarchical.
- **Active Global Address Space (AGAS)** [@kaiser2014hpx]
    To support distributed objects, HPX has implemented an address resolution
    component similar to the PGAS model. **Citation**
    This layer enables HPX to expose a uniform API for local and remote
    execution. Unlike PGAS, however, AGAS provides the user
    with the ability to move global objects in a distributed system
    without needing to create a new Global Identifier (GID)
    This enables AGAS to support load balancing via object migration.
    **More?**
- **Parcelport** [@kaiser2009parallex; @biddiscombe2017zero]
    This component is an active-message networking layer.
    The parcelport can leverage AGAS to launch functions on global objects
    regardless of where they are in a distributed system.
    Additionally, its asynchronous protocol enables the parcelport to overlap
    communication and computation implicitly.
    The parcelport is modular to support multiple communication library backends.
    By default, HPX supports TCP, Message passing Interface (MPI),
    and libfabric [@daiss2019piz].
- **Performance counters** [@grubel2016dynamic]
    HPX provides its users with a uniform suite of global counters to monitor
    system metrics. These counters have names registered with AGAS, enabling
    users to query for different metrics at runtime easily. **(Check me)**
    Additionally, HPX provides an API for users to create their own counters to
    gather information specific to their application.
    By default, HPX provides performance counters for networking,
    AGAS performance and thread scheduling.
- **Autonomic Performance Environment for Exascale (APEX)** [@huck2015autonomic]
    Often, modern applications must adapt to runtime environments to ensure
    acceptable performance. APEX enables this flexibility by accepting
    user-provided policies that are triggered by defined events.
    In this way, features such as parcel coalescing **Cite** can adapt to the
    current phase of an application or eve state of a system.
- **Accelerator Support**
    HPX has support for two methods of integration with GPUs:
    HPXCL [@diehl2018integration; @martin_stumpf_2018_1409043] and HPX.Compute
    [@copik2017using] HPXCL provides users the ability to manage GPU kernels
    through a global object. This enables HPX to coordinate the launching and
    synchronization of CPU and GPU code.
    HPX.Compute [@copik2017using] aims to provide a single-source solution to
    heterogeneity by automatically generating GPU kernels from C++ code. This
    enables HPX to launch both CPU and GPU kernels as dictated by the system's
    current state.

HPX is utilized in a diverse set of applications:
Octo-Tiger [@@daiss2019piz; @heller2019harnessing; @pfander2018accelerating],
an astrophysics code for stellar mergers,
libGeoDecomp [@Schafer:2008:LGL:1431669.1431721],
a library for stencil code based computer simulations,
and NLMech [@diehl2018implementation], a simulation tool
for non-local models, e.g., Peridyanmics.
